[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcostmap_2d.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "costmap_2d", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "costmap_2d" with
  any of the following names:

    costmap_2dConfig.cmake
    costmap_2d-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "costmap_2d" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "costmap_2d_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "costmap_2d" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
